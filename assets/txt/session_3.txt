>> Awesome, you know it! 
>> And I also just got a new job there. This is so great

>> A couple of people also don't leave money, but other interesting things 
>> The cutest thing was a crocodile plushie I got on my first day here in the city. It reminds me of the plushie you gifted to me right before my sweet 16 
>> I was even creative enough to name him Spikey haha 
>> Another time, some other guy gave me an old walkman with a cassette with probably the 15 most awesome pop punk songs of all time. That is so nice 
>> At the end of that same day, some other man tried to be a bit romantic and gave me a rose. It's a plastic rose containing 8 colors that couldn't be more different from each other. It looks actually really fancy 
>> And just today, some mysterious man gave me a photograph. 
>> It's historic, black and white, with some older man in a suit on it, and that man has torn it into pieces right in front of my eyes just before he handed it out to me 
>> This was really interesting to witness. Though I like to keep those pieces with me. 
>> Playing with numbers, coincidentally. Guess how many pieces of that torn picture he gave me :D
