>> OMG! You remember! :)) 
>> And guess what? I also got a job here!
>> Much better than selling newspapers or shovelling snow out in the cold
>> But, I’m still a bit sad because…
>> I noticed that each day as I play my guitar, the crowd seems to thin
>> Maybe they don’t like me :( 
>> People also seem to leave these little things here as payment instead of like actual money  
>> But I don’t mind, like the first day I got this crocodile plushie. I call him Spiky because he has 16 spikes (yes, I actually counted the all xD) all along his back 
>> Then the next day I found a cassette with a single lonely cassette. It had a mix of 15 songs from Green Day.  I’ve never used a Walkman before, but it sounds amazing! 
>> Yesterday I got a flower, a Clematis! Pretty in pink with 8 petals! I have…had…these in my garden…back at home 
>> Today there were even less people and I didn’t see this weird guy with a cat that had been there all the past days. I got a photograph of some old dude, guess no one liked him either…because it was torn :( Guess how many pieces it was in?
