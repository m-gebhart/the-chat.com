>>> Hey Soph, it's me. And this is my new mobile phone 
>>> My other one got stolen around a week ago
 >>> It took quite some time to replace it, excuse me
>>> Anyway, you intended to tell me something important about you and your parents? 
>> Gosh, I'm sorry about your phone
>> Great that you've got a new one though! 
>> To mom and dad... it's the same as usual 
>> They always lie to me and want me to do only what they want 
>>> I'm sorry to hear 
>>> But, hang in there! 
>>> Is there anything I can do to help you?
>> No, but thanks a lot, I appreciate that 
>> Really
>> Actually, I need to figure that out on my own 
>> And I got to think a lot in those last days 
>>> What exactly were you thinking about, Sophie? 
>>> Don't worry me, please
>> Leaving
>> I'm really thinking about leaving
>>> Sophie
>> To run away and leave everything behind 
>>> Please tell me that you are not serious about any of that 
>>>  This won't solve all of your problems
>> Hmm..... 
>> Not all of them, but probably most of them? 
>> So I could try, right? 
>> Otherwise we'll never know 
>>> Sophie
>>> No
>>> I know you 
>>> Once you have an idea on your mind, you won't stop
>>> You never stop 
>>> This is just crazy
>>> Don't do this
>> What if there's no other way? 
>>> Bullshit
>>> You don't know what other problems this will cause 
>>> I'm telling you, running away won't solve everything
>> Right, you might be right. 
>>> Think about it again, it will be better. Keep your hopes up!
>>> Please give me a call whenever you need help, okay?
>> Okay
>> I will think about it
>> And thanks for being there for me. I really appreciate that
>>> Good
>>> You're always welcome, Soph
>> [ 4 ]
>> I've done it
>> And it really feels like the right thing 
>> Believe me
>>> Please don't tell me now that you turned into a runaway girl? 
>> Guess I need to tell you that one other day, then :p 
>>> Don't be kidding, I am serious
>> I'm also serious, I have never been more serious
>> I am going to Berlin now
>> The big city!
>> And I don't think that I'll come back
>>> Oh my God, can't believe you really did it
>> Me neither!
>> I already sort of miss my room, though :/ 
>> But this is it! 
>> I know it 
>> Everything is going to be better :)
>>> What am I going to do with you?
>>> You are crazy, Sophie
>> Hahha
>> Anyway, I'm in the train right now 
>> I admit that I feel a bit lost and confused, but I can't tell you how excited I am
>> Would you meet up with me at Potsdamer Platz later? At the fancy lit up Sony center? 
>> Would be great :)
>>> Sophie, I'm already back in the UK since last week 
>>> Something came up last minute in Havard 
>>> Sorry that I didn't let you know you about this
>> Well, that's some bad luck 
>> But I should be alright, I'll find something :) 
>> Don't worry :) 
>>> Listen, I will call you when I'm back in my apartment later 
>>> Watch out for yourself, please 
>> Haha, I'll try my best :)

>> Please text me back 
>> Would you please get back to me once you've got time?
